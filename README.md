# to-do-list package

This is a simple CLI based package that lets you maintain a list of tasks that you want to get done.
A user can register to the to-do-list service using a unique user-name and a password. The password **should contain atleast one digit and one upper case letter and the minumum length of the password should be 4 and maximum can be 8.** Right now there are **no means to recover the to-do-list data if you forget the password** hence you need to be careful with remembering the password.

The functions that it supports are as follows:

* _Create a new to-do list_
* _Add a task to the list_
* _Delete a task from the list_ 
* _View a list of all the to-do list_
* _View Content of a to-do list_
* _Mark a task complete_
* _Delete a to-do list_
* _Press 0 to Exit_

All these functions are displayed as a user menu!

## **Dependencies**:

* _pyfiglet_
* _getpass_
* _termcolor_
* _colorama_

## Run 

`python to_do_list.py`
